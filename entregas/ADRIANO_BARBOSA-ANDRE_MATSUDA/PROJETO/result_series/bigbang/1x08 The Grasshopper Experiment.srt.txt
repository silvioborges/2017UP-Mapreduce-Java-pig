Damn you, WalletNook.com.
Problem?
The online description
was completely misleading.
They said eight slots plus removable lD.
To any rational person,
that would mean room for nine cards.
But they don't tell you,
the removable lD takes up one slot.
It's a nightmare.
Okay, now, do you really need...
...the honorary Justice League
of America membership card?
It's been in every wallet
I've owned since I was 5.
Why?
It says, "Keep this on your person
at all times."
[KNOCK ON DOOR]
It's right here, under Batman's signature.
And this is Leonard
and Sheldon's apartment.
[CHUCKLES]
Guess whose parents just got broadband.
Leonard, may I present, live from New Delhi,
Dr. and Mrs. V. M. Koothrappali?
Hi.
Tilt up the camera.
I'm looking at his crotch.
Sorry, Papa.
-Oh, that's much better. Hi.
-Hi.
-And over here is Sheldon.
SHELDON: Hi.
He lives with Leonard.
Oh, that's nice. Like Haroon and Tanvir.
No, not like Haroon and Tanvir.
MRS. KOOTHRAPPALl:
Such sweet young men.
They just adopted
the cutest little Punjabi baby.
Yeah. No, we're not
like Haroon and Tanvir.
-So are you boys academics like our son?
-Yes.
Your parents are comfortable
with limited earning potential?
-Oh, yes.
-Not at all.
Papa, please don't start.
What? It's just a question.
He's so sensitive.
That's my life, my friends.
Good to see you. Say bye.
-Bye.
-Bye-bye.
DR. KOOTHRAPPALl:
Wait, wait.
Before you go, we have good news.
Put the computer down
and gather your friends.
-What is it, Papa?
-I don 't see your friends.
Is it just me or does web-chatting with
your clothes on seem a little pointless?
Rajesh, do you remember Lalita Gupta?
The little fat girl that used to kick me
in the samosas and call me untouchable?
Yes. Well, now she's
a dental student at USC...
...so we gave her
your contact information.
Why did you do that?
You're 26 years old, Rajesh.
We want grandchildren.
-But, Papa, I'm not supposed--
-Lalita 's parents approved the match.
If you decide on a spring wedding,
we can avoid monsoon season.
A spring wedding?
It's up to you. We don 't want to meddle.
If you don ' t want to meddle,
why are you meddling?
Your parents don't consider this meddling.
While arranged marriages
are no longer the norm...
...Indian parents continue to have
an involvement in their children's love lives.
Why are you telling me
about my own culture?
You seemed confused.
-Sorry, but with all due respect, I don't--
-I'm sorry, darling. We have to go.
Doogie Howser is on.
Grandma, it's Doogie time.
-Bye-bye.
-Bye-bye.
I don't believe it.
Neither do l.
Doogie Howser's been off the air
for like 20 years.
Actually, I read that it's one of
the most popular programs in lndia.
Might speak to a cultural aspiration to have
one's children enter the medical profession.
LEONARD:
I bet you're right.
-I bet they love Scrubs.
-What's not to love?
Excuse me, hello?
My parents are trying to marry me off
to a stranger. What am I going to do?
-I suggest you go through with it.
-What?
Romantic love as the basis for marriage
has only existed since the 1 9th century.
Up until then, arranged marriages were
the norm and it served society quite well.
It's the premise of Fiddler on the Roof.
I'm not a big fan of musicals,
but I love that show.
Me too. Of course,
it speaks to me culturally.
Understandable, but there's a universality
to that story which transcends ethnicity.
Let's not forget
it's got some really catchy tunes.
-Oh, yeah.
-Absolutely.
-I know what I'm gonna do.
-What?
Find new friends.
[DOOR OPENS, CLOSES]
-So who wants to rent Fiddler?
-No need. We have the special edition.
Well, maybe we are like
Haroon and Tanvir.
This is Dr. Sheldon Cooper.
Yeah, I need to cancel my membership
to the planetarium.
[LAUGHlNG NOlSELESSLY]
Yeah, well, I'm sorry too...
...but there's just no room
for you in my wallet.
No, I understand, but it was between
you and the Museum of Natural History...
...and frankly, you don't have dinosaurs.
Oh, I'll miss you too. Bye-bye.
Okay, I know you're texting about me
and I'd really like you to stop.
[KNOCK ON DOOR]
Oh, dear, I am rightly and truly screwed.
I thought you were finding new friends.
I've got some feelers out.
In the meantime, listen to this.
[ON RECORDlNG]
Hi, Rajesh, this is Lalita Gupta.
Your mother gave my mother
your phone number to give to me.
So I'm calling you and call me back.
Bye.
Can you believe how pushy she is?
So don't call her.
If I don't call her,
I won't hear the end of it.
-So call her.
-How can I call her? I can't talk to women.
I'm done. Anybody else?
[GRUNTS]
-Give me the phone.
-Why?
Just give it to me. Sh.
-What are you doing?
-Don't worry, you'll thank me.
[lMlTATlNG RAJESH]
Hello, Lalita? Raj Koothrappali.
[LAUGHlNG]
Yes, it is good to talk to you too.
So, what are you wearing?
Oh, not important.
So anyhow,
when would you like to meet?
Friday works for me.
I'll call you with a time and place.
In the meantime, keep it real, babe.
[NORMAL VOlCE]
You may now thank me.
For what, making me sound
like a Simpsons character?
-Next time, make your own date.
-Didn't wanna make this one.
Look on the bright side, she might
turn out to be a nice, beautiful girl.
Great, we get married,
I won't be able to talk to her...
...and we'll spend the rest of our lives
in total silence.
It worked for my parents.
[KNOCK ON DOOR]
-Hi, guys.
-Oh, hey.
I need guinea pigs.
Okay, there's a lab animal supply
company in Reseda you could try.
But if your research is going to have
human applications, I suggest white mice.
Their brain chemistry is far closer to ours.
I swear to God, Sheldon, one day,
I'm gonna get the hang of talking to you.
His mom's been saying that for years.
-What's up?
-Well, I convinced the restaurant...
...to give me a bartending shift
so I need to practice mixing drinks.
Oh, well, great. The key to acquiring
proficiency in any task is repetition.
With certain obvious exceptions.
Suicide, for example.
So, Leonard, how about it?
Penny, we'd love to help you, but Raj
is going through some stuff right now.
And besides, he doesn't drink, so....
[WHlSPERlNG lNDlSTlNCTLY]
Really?
Um....
Raj is going through some stuff right now
and he'd like to take up drinking.
Okay, here you go, Leonard.
One Tequila Sunrise.
-Thank you.
-Mm-hm.
This drink is an example of how liquids
with different specific gravities...
...interact in a cylindrical container.
Thank you.
Okay, Raj, what'll it be?
[WHlSPERlNG lNDlSTlNCTLY]
Whatever you recommend.
How about a Grasshopper?
I make a mean Grasshopper.
Okay? Good, coming up.
-Sheldon, what are you gonna have?
-I'll have a Diet Coke.
Okay, can you please order a cocktail?
I need to practice mixing drinks.
Fine. I'll have a virgin Cuba Libre.
That's rum and Coke without the rum.
Yes.
So Coke.
Yes.
And would you make it diet?
There's a can in the fridge.
A Cuba Libre traditionally comes
in a tall glass with a lime wedge.
Then swim to Cuba.
Bartenders are supposed
to have people skills.
Okay. Raj, here you go.
All right. Who's next?
I'd like to try a Slippery Nipple.
Okay, you're cut off.
Anybody need a refill?
Where did my life go, Penny?
One day I'm a bachelor,
and the next I'm married...
...and driving a minivan to peewee cricket
matches in suburban New Delhi.
Are you talking to me?
Is there another Penny here?
I had such plans. I had dreams.
I was going to be the lndira Gandhi
of particle astrophysics.
But with a penis, of course.
It's amazing.
Ever since I was a little boy...
...my father wanted me
to be a gynecologist like him.
How can I be a gynecologist?
I can barely look a woman in the eye.
You know what? I'm not going
to let my parents control my future.
It's time for a showdown.
Somebody give me a computer
with a Webcam.
Okay. Sweetie, I think
that's the Grasshopper talking.
It's about to tell my parents...
...that I'm not riding an elephant
down the aisle with Lalita Gupta.
Okay, calm down.
No one can make you get married.
Why don't you meet this girl,
see what happens?
Haven't you been listening?
I cannot talk to women.
-Raj--
-No, no, let's see how long it takes him.
Raj, honey...
...you say you can't talk to women
but you've been talking to me.
And now we'll never know.
You're right. I--
I am talking to you.
Hello, Penny. How are you?
I'm fine.
Okay, now, I need to
make sure I have a Lalita...
...before I meet the Grasshopper.
It's a sweet green miracle.
If you're gonna drink on this date,
just promise me you won't overdo it.
Overdo what?
Happiness?
Freedom?
This warm glow inside of me that promises
everything's going to be all hunky dunky?
Yeah, that.
Why don't you bring her to my restaurant
so I can keep an eye on you?
Okay.
What's the plan? Let's say he meets her,
he likes her, they get married.
What's he gonna do,
stay drunk for the rest of his life?
It worked for my parents.
[PLAYlNG SLOW MUSlC ON PlANO]
I can't believe I'm sitting here
next to little Lalita Gupta.
Well, you are.
Little Lalita.
That's kind of fun to say.
Little Lalita, little Lalita, little Lalita.
-You should try it.
-Oh, it's okay.
You have lost so much weight.
That must have been difficult for you
because you were so, so fat.
Do you remember?
-Yes, I do.
-Of course you do.
Who could forget being that fat?
Well, I've been trying.
-So you're a dental student?
-Hmm.
Mm! Are you aware that dentists
have an extremely high suicide rate?
Not as high as air traffic controllers,
but there are far more dentists...
...than air traffic controllers,
so in pure numbers, you're still winning.
Yay, me.
Do you have a drink
that'll make him less obnoxious?
Drinks do not work that way.
I'd say he's doing fine. Look at her.
The last girl my mom set me up with
had a mustache and a vestigial tail.
-Sorry I'm late.
-What happened?
Nothing. I just really didn't wanna come.
Virgin diet Cuba Libre, please.
-Okay.
-ln a tall glass with a lime wedge.
Oh, I'll wedge it right in there.
So how's Koothrappali--?
Oh, my Lord.
-What?
-That's Princess Panchali.
I'm pretty sure her name's Lalita.
No, no. Princess Panchali
from The Monkey and The Princess.
Oh, yeah, I tried to watch that online
but they wanted my credit card.
It's a children's story.
Oh, no, it isn't.
When I was a little boy and got sick,
which was most of the time...
...my mother would read it.
It's about an lndian princess
who befriends a monkey...
...who was mocked by the other monkeys
because he was different.
For some reason,
I related to it quite strongly.
I know the reason.
We all know the reason.
Sheldon, what are you getting at?
That woman looks exactly like the pictures
of Princess Panchali in the book.
How often does one see a beloved
fictional character come to life?
Every year at Comic-Con.
Every day at Disneyland.
You can hire Snow White
to come to your house.
Of course, they prefer it if you have a kid.
Hey, guys. This is Lalita Gupta.
Lalita, this is Leonard and Sheldon
and Howard and Penny.
Isn't it great? She isn't fat anymore.
Forgive me, Your Highness...
...for I am but a monkey
and it is in my nature to climb.
I did not mean to gaze upon you
as you comb your hair.
I'm sorry?
You are the living embodiment
of the beautiful Princess Panchali.
Oh, no kidding. Who is that?
A beloved character
from an lndian folktale.
Oh.
Us lndian or "come to our casino" lndian?
-You lndian.
-Oh.
The resemblance is remarkable.
I can practically smell the lotus blossoms
woven into your ebony hair.
Well, thanks.
I imagine you smell very nice too.
I shower twice a day
and wash my hands as often as I can.
Really? So do l.
But you're a dentist, he's nuts.
Don't be insulting, Rajesh.
So, Sheldon, tell me more about
this princess you say I look like.
It was said that the gods
fashioned her eyes out of the stars...
...and that roses were ashamed to bloom
in the presence of her ruby lips.
Oh, my.
-Back off, Sheldon.
-What?
If you do not stop hitting on my lady,
you will feel the full extent of my wrath.
I'm not hitting on her.
And I am not your lady.
And you have no wrath.
You are my lady. Our parents said so.
We are, for all purposes,
1 00 percent hooked up.
Let's get something straight.
The only reason I came tonight
was to get my parents off my case.
I don't need to be getting
this old-world crap from you.
That's the kind of spirit with which Princess
Panchali led the monkeys to freedom.
-Screw Panchali.
-You can't talk to me like that.
But you're not Princess Panchali.
Luckily for you.
She could have you beheaded.
-Sheldon, are you hungry?
-I could eat.
Let's go.
What just happened?
Beats the hell out of me.
I'll tell you what happened. I just
learned how to pick up lndian chicks.
MRS. KOOTHRAPPALl: What are we
supposed to say to Lalita's parents?
I play golf with her father.
I won 't be able to look at him.
Maybe you should keep
your eye on the ball, Papa.
Oh, now you're a funnyman?
This is not funny, Mr. Funnyman.
Dr. and Mrs. Koothrappali, in all fairness,
it wasn't entirely Raj's fault.
-This is a family matter, Sheldon.
-No, I'm Leonard.
Oh. Sorry. You all look alike to us.
But he's right, Papa. Listen to him.
[DOOR OPENS]
You, you are the one
who ruined everything.
Who is it? We can 't see.
Turn us. Turn us.
Go ahead, tell my parents why
they won't have any grandchildren.
How would I know?
Do you have a low sperm count?
This has nothing to do
with my sperm count.
You are wearing the boxers
that we sent you, aren 't you?
Yes, Mommy.
You know what happens to the samosas
when you wear the tighty whities.
Can we please stop talking
about my testicles?
-Sheldon, tell them what you did.
-What did I do?
You left with his date.
Friends don't do that to each other.
Oh.
All right, noted.
-Sorry.
-"Sorry"? That's all you can say is "sorry"?
Take it, Raj.
It's more than I've ever gotten.
And may I point out...
...she wouldn't have asked me to go
if you weren't drunk and boring.
-Drunk?
-And boring. Her words.
I knew it, he moves to America
and becomes an alcoholic.
I'm not an alcoholic.
Then why were you drunk?
It was just this one time, Papa, I swear.
Are you in denial? Do we have
to come over and do an intervention?
Don 't embarrass him
in front of his friends.
All right. Carry us outside.
We want to talk to you in private.
-But, Papa, please--
-Now, Rajesh.
I have to go.
DR. KOOTHRAPPALl : Now, listen to me--
-At least wait till I get into the hall.
[DOOR CLOSES]
Okay, well, good night.
Hold on.
What happened with you and Lalita?
We ate, she lectured me on the link
between gum disease and heart attacks...
...nothing I didn't already know,
and I came home.
So you're not gonna see her again?
Why would I see her again?
I already have a dentist.
I wonder who's gonna tell his parents
that they're not having grandchildren.
[SlNGlNG AND PLAYlNG "TO LlFE"]
I don't believe it.
What's gotten into him?
Oh, maybe a couple of virgin Cuba Libres
that turned out to be kind of slutty.
[CHUCKLES]
You didn't.
Hey, you do your experiments, I do mine.
[ENGLlSH SDH]
