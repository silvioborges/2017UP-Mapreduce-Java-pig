All right, Raj has played
his Phantom Warlord card...
...and I am going to back him up
with my Strangling Vines.
Choke on that, sucker.
Okay. Well, then I'll just cut your vines
with my Ruby Sword.
That's right, I did it. I cut them.
Um...
I have a question.
Warlord beats troll, troll beats elf,
elf beats water sprite...
...and basically everything beats
Enchanted Bunny.
Unless you have the Carrot of Power.
Okay, I've got another question.
When does this get fun?
Are we gonna talk or are we gonna play
Mystic Warlords of Ka-ah?
Just play a potion card.
Which one?
It doesn't matter,
you can't possibly win.
- Don't ruin the game.
- How could he ruin the game?
Given the cards already played, Penny can
only be holding Necromancer Potions...
...which are only effective against
wraiths and daywalkers...
...and there are no more left.
The cards remaining in the stack are:
Four fire weapons, a troll,
two ogres and the Jewel of Osiris.
See? Ruined.
Sheldon, that is incredible.
From your vantage point,
it certainly must seem so.
Sheldon has kind of
a photographic memory.
"Photographic" is a misnomer.
I have an eidetic memory,
as I've told you many times.
Most recently last year during lunch
on the afternoon of May 7th.
You had turkey
and complained it was dry.
Well, I guess game's over.
Really? Oh, great.
I mean, aww...
- Okay, I gotta go.
- Why?
Because last time I didn't go,
I ended up playing Mystic Warlords of Ka.
Not "Ka." Ka-ah.
- Bye.
- See you.
Still can't believe
she's going out with me.
Nobody can.
That reminds me,
I have a bone to pick with you.
- What?
- You and I made a pact...
...that if either of us
ever got a hot girlfriend...
...that person
would have his girlfriend...
...hook the other guy up
with one of her girlfriends.
- Yeah, I don't remember that.
- Wha...?
June 30th, 2004.
Opening day of Spider-Man 2
at the AMC Pasadena.
They only had red ICEES, no blue.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, you've been with Penny
for like a month and a half.
Where's my shorty, Morty?
Howard, you can't hold me to that.
- Why not?
- When I made that agreement...
...I didn't think I'd ever have a girlfriend,
and I was positive you never would.
- How come I wasn't part of this deal?
- You had left the refreshment stand...
...in order to indulge in your customary
preemptive pre-show urination.
So that's how it works? I have a teeny
bladder and I don't get a hot girlfriend?
Yeah, Raj, that's how it works.
Damn.
Oh, damn it. Can I have a napkin?
I'm sorry, no.
But you have a whole bunch of them.
Yes, I've moved
to a four-napkin system.
Lap, hands, face
and personal emergency.
If you like, starting tomorrow
I'll add a guest napkin...
...but I'm afraid
there's nothing I can do for you today.
Good luck. That's the face napkin.
- So have you talked to Penny yet?
- No, I haven't.
- Why not?
- Because I've been busy.
Because I haven't figured out a way
to bring it up.
And mostly,
and I can't stress how key this is...
...because I don't want to.
A pact is a pact.
You have to get Penny to fix me up.
It's not that simple.
What am I supposed to say?
"Penny, you have any friends
you'd like to never hear from again?"
Come on. I'm smart, I have a good job.
And I have only 3 percent body fat.
It's true. I've seen him at the beach.
He's like a human chicken wing.
Leonard, come on.
- Fine, I'll ask if she has a friend for you.
- A hot friend.
- Right.
- And tall.
I want our kids to be able to ride
Space Mountain before they're 20.
I'll see what I can do.
Hey, guess what I heard today.
I'd imagine you heard
any number of things today.
When you arrived at work,
you undoubtedly heard:
"Hello. How are you, Raj?"
You're wearing a new sweater vest,
you may have heard:
"New sweater vest?" And possibly,
though less likely, "Nice sweater vest."
Why don't I just tell you
what I heard today?
That would probably save us
some time.
Saturday night
at the comic-book store...
...they're having a Mystic Warlords
of Ka-ah tournament. First prize is $500.
- If we team up, we'd be unstoppable.
- I'm sorry, Raj.
I have no interest in playing a game
in which I find no challenge.
- But what about the money?
- I have money.
But this is other money.
How does it differ
from the money I have?
Half of it will be mine.
Do you need it
to buy a less disturbing sweater vest?
- Leonard, help.
- Are you kidding?
I couldn't even talk him into giving me
one of his freaking napkins.
Wow, you really are a genius.
Not really. I Googled how to do that.
So listen...
Have you ever made a pact
with someone?
You mean like a pinky swear?
Okay, fine. Like a pinky swear.
In the first grade, my friend Rosie and I
made a pact to marry Bert and Ernie.
- You know, from Sesame Street.
- I'm familiar with Bert and Ernie.
Then we found out
we both wanted Ernie.
We didn't speak again
till middle school.
Over puppets?
The heart wants what the heart wants,
Leonard.
Okay.
Speaking of what the heart wants, um...
...a long time ago I made a pact
with Wolowitz that kind of involves you.
Okay, I don't know
where you're going with this...
...but tread carefully because it may be
the last conversation we ever have.
No, no, nothing like that.
No, the deal was that
if either of us ever got a girlfriend...
...we'd have her fix the other one up
with one of her friends.
You thought a good time to bring this up
would be right after sex?
Well, I sure as hell wasn't gonna
bring it up before sex.
And during I was trying to remember
what I read on Google, so...
I'm not hooking Wolowitz up
with my friends.
Come on,
it doesn't have to be a good friend.
And you know that deep down inside,
Howard's a really nice guy.
The problem isn't what's on the inside.
It's the creepy candy coating.
Will you at least think about it?
Just as a favor to me?
The great thing about Ernie
was he never asked me for anything.
He just gave.
Got it. Got it. Got it.
Betty and Veronica. Oh.
Hey, Sheldon, the new Green Lantern
figurine's coming in tomorrow.
- Want me to set one aside for you?
- Thank you.
You just robbed me of the opportunity
to stumble upon the figurine...
...and make the oh-so-satisfying journey
from discovery to desire to possession.
- All right, I won't.
- But I must have it.
- Okay, I'll set one aside for you.
- Thank you.
I can buy all these things online.
I come here for the personal service.
Stuart, is the Wil Wheaton signed up
for the Mystic Warlords Tournament...
...the Wil Wheaton from Star Trek?
Yeah, he lives around here. Big gamer.
Excuse me,
are you saying that Wil Wheaton...
...a.k.a. Ensign Wesley Crusher
on Star Trek: The Next Generation...
...is participating in your tournament?
I'm sorry, did I rob you of the opportunity
to stumble onto that for yourself?
No, wait, you don't understand.
Growing up, I idolized Wil Wheaton.
You know, Wesley Crusher
had an eidetic memory just like me.
Oh, what a coincidence.
You can discuss that with him...
...while playing in the tournament.
Sign here.
Yeah, I was such a fan that in 1995
I traveled 10 hours by bus...
...to a sci-fi convention
in Jackson, Mississippi...
...wearing my Starfleet Academy
cadet uniform...
...in order to meet Wil Wheaton
and get him to autograph...
...my mint-in-package
Wesley Crusher action figure.
Oh, it'll be like a reunion then.
Sign here.
Yeah, my arduous journey, however,
was for naught.
Although advertised to appear,
he did not show up.
It was at that moment
I vowed eternal hatred for Wil Wheaton.
Okay, great,
you can tell him you hate him. Sign here.
It might interest you to know
that Wil Wheaton currently ranks sixth...
...on my all-time enemies list, right
between director Joel Schumacher...
...who nearly destroyed
the Batman movie franchise...
...and Billy Sparks,
who lived down the street from me...
...and put dog poop
on the handles of my bicycle.
Okay, I get it. He's a bad guy.
Sign here.
In the words of Khan Noonien Singh
in the immortal Wrath of Khan:
"He tasks me.
He tasks me and I shall have him."
- No doubt. Sign here.
- "From hell's heart, I stab at thee."
All right, Raj.
Looks like you're teamed up with...
..."Die, Wil Wheaton, die."
So tell me more
about the future mother of my children.
She's adorable, Howard.
I think you'll like her.
Great.
What did you tell her about me?
Did you mention body fat?
No, I thought
that'd be a nice surprise for her.
Good, good.
I told her you're an aerospace engineer,
you speak five languages...
Six, if you count Klingon.
Girls don't count Klingon, Howard.
- Right?
- Right.
And I told her you have
an unhealthy attachment to your mother.
- What?
- I'm kidding.
Another delightful surprise for her.
Sheldon, it's your play.
Sheldon.
My Enchanted Troll bludgeons
your Screaming Harpy...
...with a Cursed Mace. Game.
Sorry, boys. Say hi to your mother
when she picks you up.
Or I could just tell her later tonight.
Ha-ha-ha.
We pawned them, dude. Up top.
Look at him.
Wil Wheaton, my old friend.
I have chased you
around the moons of Nibia...
...and around the Antares Maelstrom,
and around Perdition's flames.
You keep quoting Wrath of Khan,
but he was in Next Generation.
- It's a totally different set of characters.
- Silence.
How much longer must I wait
for my revenge?
If Wil Wheaton
and Stuart win their match...
...and we beat Lonely Larry and
Captain Sweatpants in the next round...
...we'll face off for championship.
So my path to satisfaction is blocked
by Lonely Larry and Captain Sweatpants.
Very well, they must be destroyed.
Dude, you have to stop talking like that.
It's really lame.
Silence.
So Penny tells me
you're working as a waitress...
...to put yourself through grad school.
That's great.
- What are you studying?
- Microbiology.
Oh, cool. So you could study me.
I don't understand.
Microbiology is the study
of tiny living things.
I know, I'm studying it.
Yeah, and I said you could study me
because I'm a tiny living thing.
- It's a joke.
- Are you sure?
- Do you like science fiction?
- No.
- Role-playing games?
- Like in the bedroom...
...or like Dungeons and Dragons?
- Either.
- No.
- You like...?
- It's gonna be a long night.
- Yeah, well, it's your fault.
- I had to ask, you didn't have to say yes.
You like magic?
- Not really.
- Okay.
Long, long night.
I play my Endless Serpent,
Raj will play Ecstatic Frenzy...
...which means Larry
will have to play Chaos Overlord.
Then Captain Sweatpants,
Molten River.
I play Nightshade Dryad.
Game, set and match.
Now fetch me Wil Wheaton.
Did that guy just say, "Revenge is a dish
best served cold," in Klingon?
I believe so.
What is wrong with him?
Everyone has a different theory.
How about computers?
You like computers?
I use them. I don't like them.
Okay. Puppies.
Where do you stand on puppies?
A puppy once bit my face.
Of course it did.
- How about that? Einstein was wrong.
- What?
Approaching the speed of light doesn't
slow down time, approaching them does.
Excuse me.
Oh, damn. It's my mother.
- Are you going to answer it?
- I'm torn.
She might be dying and, you know,
wouldn't want to miss that.
On other hand, if let it go to voicemail,
I could play it over and over.
I know how you feel.
My mother makes me crazy.
Yeah, not as crazy
as my mother makes me.
Yeah? Does your mother call you
every day at work...
...to see if you've had a healthy lunch?
My mother calls me at work to see
if I had a healthy bowel movement.
Okay, does she lay out your clothes
for you in the morning...
...like you're 9 years old?
- You live with your mother?
- No. That's the sad part.
Rough. Okay, check this out.
My mother made me wear rubber gloves
to kindergarten...
...so I wouldn't pick up a disease
from the other children.
That's nothing.
I couldn't ride a bicycle...
...because my mother was afraid
I'd hit a bump and lose my virginity.
Oh, wow, you didn't, did you?
Not on a bicycle. In a Camry.
A Corolla.
- More wine?
- I'd love some.
Listen, you have to come
to Shabbat dinner at my house sometime.
Why?
A Catholic girl like you
wearing a big cross like that...
...might just give my mother the big
brain aneurysm I've been hoping for.
Okay, but only if you come to Sunday
dinner at my house wearing a yarmulke.
It's a date.
Am I a matchmaker or what?
Lava Serpent.
Nest of Snakes.
- Underworld Guardian.
- Underworld Guardian.
We skirmish to the death.
- Invisibility Spell.
- Luminescence Spell.
- Water nymph.
- Fire demon.
- Two-headed tiger.
- Three-headed lion.
- Sulfur.
- Brimstone.
Problem, Wil Wheaton?
Hang on.
You're holding two moderate spell cards,
a Small Rock and a Potion of Zancor...
...which will be as much help as an
air conditioner on the ice planet Hoth.
Your only move is to play the potion,
lose the skirmish...
...and two moves later, the game.
- I think he's got me.
- The year was 1995.
The place, Jackson, Mississippi.
Having spent 10 hours on a bus...
...during which I had
to twice violate my personal rule...
...against relieving myself
onboard a moving vehicle...
...I finally arrived at the
Fourth Annual Dixie Trek Convention...
...only to find that my idol,
Wil Wheaton...
...decided he had better things to do
than show up and sign my action figure.
What?
You betrayed me, Wil Wheaton.
Now I have my revenge.
You went to the '95 Dixie Trek?
Oh, dude, my grandmother had just died,
and I had to go to her funeral.
Your memaw died?
That's terrible.
Yeah. It was.
But I'm really sorry
that I disappointed you.
No, no, I understand.
If anything happened to my memaw,
I'd be one inconsolable Moon Pie.
I should clarify that statement
by explaining that she calls me Moon Pie.
It's a special relationship, isn't it?
Between a boy and his grandmother.
- Oh, yes.
- Yeah, okay.
Okay, great,
everybody loves their grandmas.
Now, come on, Sheldon,
finish him off.
Yeah. It's okay, Sheldon.
I let you down.
I deserve it.
Potion of Zancor.
What are you waiting for?
Kill Wil Wheaton.
From hell's heart, stab at him.
- I can't.
- Sure you can. Do it. Do it.
No.
I came here to defeat Wil Wheaton,
the man who destroyed my dreams.
But I can't defeat Wil Wheaton,
the man who loved his memaw.
- Enchanted Bunny.
- No!
Not Enchanted Bunny!
I call my memaw "nana."
And she's gonna be very happy
to hear...
...that my Small Rock
kills your Enchanted Bunny.
Game over, Moon Pie.
I don't understand.
Your grandmother's alive?
Oh, you catch on quick.
Come on, Stewie,
let's get our prize money.
That was fun.
Wheaton!
Wheaton!
