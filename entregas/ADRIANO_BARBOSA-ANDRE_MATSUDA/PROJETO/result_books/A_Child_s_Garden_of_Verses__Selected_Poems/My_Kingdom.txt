Down by a shining water well I found a very little dell,       No higher than my head. The heather and the gorse about In summer bloom were coming out,       Some yellow and some red. I called the little pool a sea; The little hills were big to me;       For I am very small. I made a boat, I made a town, I searched the caverns up and down,       And named them one and all. And all about was mine, I said, The little sparrows overhead,       The little minnows too. This was the world and I was king; For me the bees came by to sing,       For me the swallows flew. I played there were no deeper seas, Nor any wider plains than these,       Nor other kings than me. At last I heard my mother call Out from the house at evenfall,       To call me home to tea. And I must rise and leave my dell, And leave my dimpled water well,       And leave my heather blooms. Alas! and as my home I neared, How very big my nurse appeared.       How great and cool the rooms!
