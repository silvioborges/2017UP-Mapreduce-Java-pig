O it’s I that am the captain of a tidy little ship,       Of a ship that goes a sailing on the pond; And my ship it keeps a-turning all around and all about; But when I’m a little older, I shall find the secret out       How to send my vessel sailing on beyond. For I mean to grow as little as the dolly at the helm,       And the dolly I intend to come alive; And with him beside to help me, it’s a-sailing I shall go, It’s a-sailing on the water, when the jolly breezes blow       And the vessel goes a divie-divie-dive. O it’s then you’ll see me sailing through the rushes and the reeds,       And you’ll hear the water singing at the prow; For beside the dolly sailor, I’m to voyage and explore, To land upon the island where no dolly was before,       And to fire the penny cannon in the bow.
