Dark brown is the river,       Golden is the sand. It flows along for ever,       With trees on either hand. Green leaves a-floating,       Castles of the foam, Boats of mine a-boating—       Where will all come home? On goes the river       And out past the mill, Away down the valley,       Away down the hill. Away down the river,       A hundred miles or more, Other little children       Shall bring my boats ashore.
