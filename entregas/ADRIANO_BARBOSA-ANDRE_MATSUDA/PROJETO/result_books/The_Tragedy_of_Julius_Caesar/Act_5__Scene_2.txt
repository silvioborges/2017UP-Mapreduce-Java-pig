SCENE II. The same. The field of battle. [Alarum. Enter Brutus and Messala.] BRUTUS. Ride, ride, Messala, ride, and give these bills Unto the legions on the other side: Let them set on at once; for I perceive But cold demeanor in Octavius’ wing, And sudden push gives them the overthrow. Ride, ride, Messala: let them all come down. [Exeunt.]
